## Concepts Covered

- **Regular Expression**: In this project, we delve into the usage of regular expressions using Oniguruma, a library commonly used with Ruby.

## Background Context

The project revolves around building regular expressions using the Oniguruma library. Here's a snippet of Ruby code demonstrating how to use regular expressions:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join
```
